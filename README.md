# C64-Control-Port-Switch-Rapid-Fire-
This is a Control Port Switch for the Commodore C64. It provides a rapid fire function. Other than an auto fire function, it fires only as long as the fire button is pressed. And the firing is synchronized with pressing this button. The delay is <= 1msec - the human reaction time is about 300msec.
